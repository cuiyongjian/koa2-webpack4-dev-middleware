# koa2-webpack4-dev-middleware

koa2 style for [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware)

## Feature

* use express-to-koa library to transform the native [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) to Koa2.
* because we use the newest version of webpack-dev-middleware, so we solved the warning `Tapable.plugin is deprecated`
